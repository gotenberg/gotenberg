        the page to PDF using the underlying headless Chrome instance.
        You can optionally include `header.html` and `footer.html` files as part of the request as well.
        See externalDocs for more details.

        This route accepts multipart/form-data requests and files with the following extensions:

        By default, if you send more than one file to convert, the route returns a ZIP archive of the
        resulting PDF files. However, you may prefer to merge all the PDF files into an individual PDF file.

        > **Attention:** The files will be merged alphabetically for the
        resulting PDF.

        You may also specify the page ranges to convert from the incoming Office
        documents. The expected format is the same as the one from the print
        options of LibreOffice, e.g. `1-1` or `1-4`.

        > **Attention:** if more than one document, the page ranges will be
        applied for each document.

        You can also request conversion to HTML format, but this disables the merge capabilities.

        See externalDocs for more details.
